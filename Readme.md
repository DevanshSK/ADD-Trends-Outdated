# ADD Trends

An online fashion ecommerce store based on the React + Django tech stack. 

## Description

ADD Trends is an online shopping system that provides 
solutions to minimize and optimize these costs. 
Authorized customers do not need to visit the store to pick up 
and return the products they need. They simply browse through 
their personal computer or mobile phone to visit stores and 
evaluate product descriptions and screen images to select 
products. 
Furthermore, store owners do not need to organize or display 
their inventory products. They simply enter product descriptions 
and prices and upload their photos. 
Simply, customers and store owners do not need to touch the 
actual product during the entire shopping and management 
process. 
Finally, the logistics center will deliver products ordered by 
customers or products ordered by merchants to their location. 
Customers can track the status of their orders until delivery, 
after which they can leave a review on the type of service they 
received. 
The payment and quantity of products will be recorded in the 
database through the feed. These purchasing, management, 
and distribution processes greatly simplify and optimize the 
retail challenge.
